# hello-world
What a refreshing new look on the coding community. When I was 12 I first started my long, painful, and frustrating dive into the world of computers and web-development. A lot has changed since I picked up some inspiration to start coding again. I guess Ill be another one of old timers saying "back in my day all we had was notepad and HTML, we were lucky to have MySQL database driven websites cuz used 2 only the rich folk had them kinda' things"

Sigh. Those were better days. As the saying goes though, "if you dont lose it you lose it." So I decided to dive right back in, get my feet super freakin' wet, and learn all this new stuff everyones improved on.....
